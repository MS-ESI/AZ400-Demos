# Bicep deployment demo

This demo deploys a Bicep template which references a key vault, and at the same time uses some features like referencing an existing resource, using secure parameters, etc.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account and having Azure CLI installed.

## Before the class

Replace the `subscriptionId` value in the `parameters.json` file within the `.azure` folder with your subscription id. Then run all the commands in the `run.azcli` file in a bash shell except the last line.

## During the class

Show the template to the learners and run the last command.

> **Note**: If you have closed your terminal or are using a new one, just run the first line of the script to define the resource group name variable.
